## Summary

As a engineer, I am most interested in making technology work for humans. I am a curious person, always on lookout to learn something new. During the course of my journey in software, I have worked in several disciplines - systems engineering, software engineering, Web applicaiton development, DevOps, Engineering Management. I have worked as an individual contributor as well as a leader. The human aspect of building teams and getting people to work together interests me greatly apart from the obvious love of technology.
