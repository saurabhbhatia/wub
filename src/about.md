title: About
---

I am Saurabh Bhatia, a programmer, writer, author, open source enthusiast and a comic book aficionado who currently lives in Sydney, Australia with a lovely wife and two amazing girls.

I was introduced to computers at a very early age and was always enticed by them. I feel really fortunate to have made a career out of programming. I currently work as an Engineering Manager at the moment but aim to be a Principal engineer.

One of the recurring themes in my career has been working in small teams, really early in a company's lifecycle. This has allowed me to work on a lot of
hard problems - long running rewrites, scaling existing systems for massive growth, scaling teams to handle fast growth and setting up high performing, motivated teams that continuously deliver.

I have been really lucky to work alongside some great humans and have appreciated their support in my career. I love to write and I write everything from Tech to fiction.
